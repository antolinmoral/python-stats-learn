python-stats-learn
==================

A collection of ipython notebooks illustrating [The Elements of Statistical Learning][1],
by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. It's purpose is to teach me, and anyone
who follows along, the statistics and machine learning concepts contained therein. I plan to update it on a weekly
schedule, progressing through the book.

There will be a separate [iPython notebook][2] for each chapter. It will cover selected exercises (esp. those 
computation-focused ones), and other illustrations relevant to the chapter.

The best way to consume these chapters is to run a notebook server in the root directory of this repository. 
Alternatively, you can [export notebooks to HTML][3] and view them in a browser or publish them.

It's recommended to run these examples in a virtualenv, with the packages specified in `requirements.txt`.
